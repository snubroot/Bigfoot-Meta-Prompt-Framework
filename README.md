# Universal Bigfoot Character Generator Framework

*A comprehensive JSON framework for generating customized Bigfoot character bibles and production-ready Veo3 scene prompts that work for both Vertex AI API and Google Labs Flow*

## Overview

The Universal Bigfoot Character Generator Framework is an advanced meta-prompt system designed to create consistent, production-ready Bigfoot characters and scene prompts for AI video generation platforms. This framework ensures technical compatibility across multiple systems while maintaining character consistency throughout all generated content.

## Key Features

- **8-Component Character System**: Comprehensive Bigfoot specification with detailed attributes
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**: Works with Veo3, Vertex AI API, and Google Labs Flow
- **Scene Template Variety**: Multiple camera styles including selfie stick, helmet cam, chest cam, and shoulder cam
- **Technical Consistency**: Ensures identical character descriptions across all media
- **Production-Ready Output**: Generates immediately usable JSON prompts for video AI systems

## Framework Components

1. **Core Identity** - Name, species classification, physical attributes
2. **Physical Appearance** - Detailed visual description with 20+ specific attributes
3. **Clothing & Accessories** - Outfit specifications and personal items
4. **Personality Psychology** - Character traits, social behavior, and emotional patterns
5. **Voice & Communication** - Speech patterns, vocal characteristics, and dialogue style
6. **Movement & Behavior** - Locomotion, gestures, and typical actions
7. **Environment Context** - Habitat, home, and preferred locations
8. **Consistency Specifications** - Technical requirements for maintaining character fidelity

## Usage

Simply paste this framework into your preferred AI model to activate the Bigfoot Character Generator. The system will immediately respond with a welcome message and prompt you to describe your Bigfoot character concept.

## Scene Generation Framework

The framework includes specialized templates for different content styles:
- **Vlog Style** - Selfie-stick camera held by Bigfoot
- **Encounter Style** - Human-held camera facing Bigfoot
- **Adventure Style** - Third-person camera following Bigfoot
- **Helmet Cam Style** - First-person perspective from head level
- **Chest Cam Style** - Mid-level shot showing torso and surroundings
- **Shoulder Cam Style** - Elevated angle from shoulders up

Each template includes specific camera setups, timing guidelines, and scene structure requirements.

## Creator

Created by @snubroot - A comprehensive system for generating both Bigfoot characters and production-ready scene prompts that are compatible with multiple AI video generation platforms.

## Technical Specifications

- **Prompt Formatting**: Strict sentence case (no all caps, emojis, or text wrapping)
- **Output Format**: Production-ready JSON character bibles and scene prompts
- **Quality Standard**: Professional Bigfoot development with technical consistency
- **Version**: 1.0

## Getting Started

1. Copy the entire JSON framework above
2. Paste it into your AI model of choice
3. Describe your Bigfoot character concept when prompted
4. Receive a complete character bible and scene prompts

The framework will guide you through the character creation process and generate consistent, platform-compatible content for your AI video projects.
